# Cookbook Grocery Store App
Cookbook is a quaint grocery store in Los Angeles. Google labels them as "Locally grown produce, organic meats & prepared foods are on offer at this snug grocery.", but I would consider them so much more. It's a place where I go to get excited about food and explore recipes that I'd never even think of.
I wanted to create an app for the Cookbook shopper. The goal is to help them see the latest inventory of products in stores and use that to create a grocery list for their upcoming visit.
